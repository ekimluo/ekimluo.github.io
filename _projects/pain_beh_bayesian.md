### What we wanted to know
We wanted to investigate whether there were gender- and age-related differences in how social power affects empathy for pain. Specifically, to remove prior bias from knowing the results of individual studies, a Bayesian approach with weakly informative priors is used.
### What we did
We ran a Bayesian meta-analysis using the `brms` library in R, which uses Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm and its extension, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), to perform Bayesian inference.
