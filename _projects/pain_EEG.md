### What we wanted to know
Building on previous studies that investigated the ERP components of empathy for pain, we wanted to examine whether power affected the neural components that underpinned empathy for pain. Specifically, we wanted to examine whether it affected the early automatic or late cognitive components differently. We also wanted to see whether any differences we observed in the neural responses might predict subsequent prosocial behavior.
### What we did
We had participants come into the lab and fitted them with EEG caps. They completed an empathy for pain task while wearing an EEG cap. Afterwards, they completed a naturalistic prosocial task that allowed us to assess how much time they were willing to spend helping someone else, and how much effort they exerted while doing so.
