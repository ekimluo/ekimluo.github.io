### What we did
We implemented established methods and built an EEG preprocessing library in Python to automate some aspects of the very tedious task. We are calling it GRAPE. Also, thank you [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html), because GRAPE wouldn't otherwise exist. We are currently preparing the manuscript for this!
