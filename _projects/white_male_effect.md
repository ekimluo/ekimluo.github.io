### What we wanted to know
Using a longitudinal panel survey, we wanted to examine whether there were consistent differences in how different demographic groups perceived the mortality risks of COVID-19.

### What we did
As a part of the [Understanding America Study](https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php), we analyzed data between April 2020 and July 2021. Participants were asked to assess how likely it was that they would die from COVID-19. 

### What we found
We found that White men tended to have lower COVID-19 mortality risk perceptions, a phenomenon observed across many other domains. Check out the [repositories](/repositories/) page if you want to see the code and supplement!
