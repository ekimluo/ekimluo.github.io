### What we wanted to know
We wanted to investigate whether there is a relationship between social power and empathy for pain.
### What we did
We first assessed participants' real-world sense of power to see if there was any correlational evidence. Participants also completed a well-established empathy for pain task across many trials. We then built upon correlational results and designed a role-play task to simulate real-world power dynamics - this was done with clever `javascript` scripts on Gorilla - and we examined whether there was any difference in empathy for pain for participants assigned to each role.
