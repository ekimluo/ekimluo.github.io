- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Life-changing note-taking software. Actually wrote my PhD thesis in this, though there were some drawbacks like formatting issues (and having to tinker with CSS, not fun). Overall for thesis writing, I would say 5/10. For general note-taking, 11/10.
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). Stay organized on your literature review! 
- Google sheets. This is a no-brainer. I attach scripts to my sheets. For example, my planner uses a combination of Google functions and scripts, which allows me to calculate, predict and visualize my workload for each project. It requires some tinkering, but even for a JavaScript newbie like me, I can still cobble together something that works. Try [this spreadsheet planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ITJjKecpX3l_cGzcWXZHVgF_RgODKm-kmM469jz0aUs/edit?usp=sharing) out if you want a reference point (it's got a gantt chart and everything). Feel free to make a copy and tinker with the Apps Scripts!
- Visual Studio Code. Another no-brainer. Even though we usually teach programming using R Studio and Jupyter notebooks, I typically encourage students to use Visual Studio Code for their projects. It's a bit more complicated to set up, but it's worth it in the long run.
