Hi there! I am an experimental scientist studying pain. I obtained my PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Cambridge in February, 2024. In my PhD, I used a combination of behavioral tasks and EEG to understand the social and individual factors that modulated how we perceived someone else's pain, or empathy for pain. During my PhD, I also taught bioinformatics courses within the School of Biological Sciences in my spare time, as well as serving as a statistics and methods consultant for the Department of Psychology. 

I currently live in Cambridge, United Kingdom, though I grew up in Shanghai, China. I moved to Minnesota, United States when I was sixteen years old, where I had spent some formative years of my life. I later moved to Austria on an exchange program during which I attempted to learn German and eventually gave up. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Psychology at the University of Southern California, where I worked as a research assistant in several labs that jump-started my research career. 

Growing up I had wanted to become a writer. Neither of my parents have a bachelor's degree, so it was difficult to imagine myself doing a PhD. However, it turns out that I absolutely love doing research, and the fact that I was able to do this in my early to mid twenties made these somewhat existential years easier to navigate. That said, I realize that doing a PhD has its ups and downs, and mine was not an exception. Because of this, I am forever indebted to the mentors, friends, and especially my partner in life, for supporting me through it all - many of them continue to inspire me in their own scientific pursuits. 

My first job out of college was writing for a theater company based in Chicago, and I still occasionally write. I also love spreadsheeting whenever I'm free. Besides that, I'm a classically trained pianist, although I'm getting pretty rusty these days. My most impressive skill is being able to make thirty-minute, one-pot meals that taste good and contain vegetables. I love reading works by Haruki Murakami and Elizabeth Strout, and one of my dreams is to have coffee with them one day. Finally, I have always loved everything about the mind and the brain.

### Research Background
Before I started my PhD, I specialized in qualitative coding of dyadic interactions and stress, meaning I observed people interact with each other, specifically couples, interviewer and interviewees, on a second-by-second timescale and noted down their behavior and expressions of feelings. It sounds very subjective, but I had worked on these qualitative coding projects with at least one or two other researchers, and we would follow a guidebook (such as Gottman's SPAFF code) to standardize our interpretation of participants' behavior and facial expressions. We do this as a team so as to establish inter-rater reliability, meaning we want to come up with a quantitative measure of how much we agreed with each other on our interpretations.

In my PhD, I used a combination of psychological scales, behavioral tasks and electroencephalogram (EEG) to understand pain perception. I examined individual differences in pain perception and the effect of psychosocial factors on pain perception, such as having a sense of control or power. I also evaluated the behavioral consequences of differences in pain perception, specifically whether how we process pain might affect how much we are willing to help someone else in distress. To induce a sense of control and power in participants, I use a combination of role play task and memory recall task. This means I simulate a real-life situation where each participant is assigned to a particular role corresponding to having different levels of control and power, and I ask participants to write about a particular past experience to elicit its associated psychological state. To implement my experimental ideas, I primarily use `PsychoPy` and `Gorilla` to code specific tasks, although where applicable, I also use simple but effective tasks that require no code or computer, like writing with pen and paper.
