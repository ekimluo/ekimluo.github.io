# 👁‍🗨 Hello!
I am an experimental scientist studying pain. I obtained my PhD in Experimental Psychology at the University of Cambridge in February, 2024. In my PhD, I used a combination of behavioral tasks and EEG to understand the social and individual factors that modulated how we perceived someone else's pain, or empathy for pain. During my PhD, I also taught bioinformatics courses within the School of Biological Sciences in my spare time, as well as serving as a statistics and methods consultant for the Department of Psychology. 

I currently live in Cambridge, United Kingdom, though I grew up in Shanghai, China. I moved to Minnesota, United States when I was sixteen years old, where I had spent some formative years of my life. I later moved to Austria on an exchange program during which I attempted to learn German and eventually gave up. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Psychology at the University of Southern California, where I worked as a research assistant in several labs that jump-started my research career. 

I love spreadsheeting whenever I'm free. Besides that, I'm a classically trained pianist, although I'm getting pretty rusty these days. My most impressive skill is being able to make thirty-minute, one-pot meals that taste good and contain vegetables. I love reading works by Haruki Murakami and Elizabeth Strout, and one of my dreams is to have coffee with them one day. Finally, I have always loved everything about the mind and the brain.
