### ℹ️For prospective thesis students

I have mentored thesis students from medical sciences as well as psychology, and they have had a diverse background in terms of research skills. You are welcome to reach out with specific questions. If you are a medic or Natural Sciences Tripos student, simply sign up to thesis projects the same way that psychology students do. You don't need necessary statistical training prior to arriving at the lab; you are welcome to either attend one of my lectures at the Bioinformatics Training Facility or, if the timing doesn't work out, come to my statistical analysis workshop before you start analyzing data. Last year, I provided the following training to all thesis students and research assistants:

- Conducting literature review workshop
- Hands-on EEG practical sessions
- EEG theory workshop
- Statistical analysis using R workshop
- Data analysis plan review
- Code review
- Thesis outline review
- Group and one-on-one meetings for questions

I will keep providing the same resources to future cohorts. Note that you are expected to attend at least most of them unless you already have extensive training in these areas; otherwise you will probably struggle in your thesis project. 

### ℹ️For prospective research assistants 

Thanks for taking interest in my research! Most students ask me what they should do or learn before starting at the lab, and my answer is the same: think about what you want to learn instead of what you can do for us. For example, are you interested in learning statistics with me? Do you want to learn how to set up an EEG lab? Are you primarily interested in working with data? Not everyone who expresses an interest in my research ends up working with me. I also ask about everyone's research interests and signpost them to different labs or people that would best help them advance their research career. Sometimes students have no idea what they want to do, but just want to give research a try. That's totally OK. If that's you, I can get you started on basic research training, like how to read a paper and learn about a subject. You should expect to learn and gain something out of this experience, and while that could mean working on a particular experiment, it entirely depends on what you really want to get out of it and whether I have the capacity to shepherd you towards your goals.
